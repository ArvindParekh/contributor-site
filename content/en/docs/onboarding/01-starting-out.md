# Welcome to Kubernetes!

Welcome to the E-Learning for Contributors course for Kubernetes!

---

# Section 1: Starting Out

Each unit of this course consists of a slideshow and links to resources. Take your time reading the materials, and feel free to reach out to the community with questions.

We look forward to your contributions!

---

# What you are about to learn

This first unit is all about starting out in the Kubernetes community. By the end of this unit, you will:

* Understand the organization of the K8s community, special interest groups, committees, and working groups.
* Communicate effectively with the community.
* Understand and be able to work with the K8s code of conduct and community values.

---

# Who exactly is a contributor?

Kubernetes contributors bring a wide range of talents, skills, services, and ideas to the community. They:

* Write documentation
* Write and review code
* Participate in the community
* Participate in special interest groups
* AND MORE!

Everybody's contributions are welcome in the Kubernetes community!

---

# What are the core values of the Kubernetes community?

The Kubernetes community adheres to the following principles:

* Distribution is better than centralization 
* Community over product or company
* Automation over process
* Inclusive is better than exclusive
* Evolution is better than stagnation

[Read more about our community values.](/community/values/)

---

# What behavior is expected of contributors?

The Kubernetes community strives to be safe, respectful and inclusive. We expect all contributors to:

* Abide by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](/community/code-of-conduct/)
* Help foster an open and welcoming community
* Respect their fellow contributors.

# What is the CNCF Code of Conduct?

_"The Kubernetes Code of Conduct is in effect, so please be excellent to each other." â€” Jorge Castro, 2020 SIG ContribEx co-chair_

The Code of Conduct serves as a set of rules used by the Kubernetes community to uphold our core values and establish a safe, respectful and inclusive environment.

* Our code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

---

# Who oversees and enforces the Code of Conduct?

The Code of Conduct Committee oversees and handles all incidents and responses regarding code of conduct issues and violations.

* [Read about the committee's reporting and response process.](/community/code-of-conduct-incident-process/)

---

# How is the Kubernetes community organized?

Most community activity is organized into four areas:

* Special Interest Groups (SIGs), 
* Working Groups
* Committees
* The community meeting

---

# What are Special Interest Groups?

We are organized primarily into Special Interest Groups, or SIGs. Each SIG is composed of members from multiple companies and organizations. In addition, each SIG:

* Works to advance the project with respect to a specific topic, such as Networking or Documentation.
* Has a charter that specifies its scope, responsibilities, and governance.

---

# What is a working group?

A working group facilitates topics of discussion that cross SIG lines. They are a vehicle for consensus building. A working group:

1. Provides a formal avenue for collaboration around a common problem,
2. Crafts a balanced position, 
3. And then disbands!

---

# What is a committee?

Some topics, such as Security or Code of Conduct, require discretion. Committees do not have open membership and do not always operate in the open. 

* The steering committee forms committees as needed.
* All committee members must be community members. 
* Like a SIG, a committee has a charter and a chair.

---

# What is the community meeting and when does it happen?

The Kubernetes community has a [monthly public, recorded meeting](/community/community-meeting/). 

* Currently, that meeting is held third Thursday of the month at 10am PT
* With the exception of December!
* Or in the event it clashes with KubeCon or CloudNativeCon.

---

# Where can I learn more?

The [Kubernetes Community Resources page](/community/) has links to documents that describe our community structure and governance.

* [The Community Groups page](/community/community-groups/) lists all current SIGs, working groups, and committees.
* [The governance document](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md) drills down into more of the specifics.
