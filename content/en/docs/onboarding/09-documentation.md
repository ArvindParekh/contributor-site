# Section 9: Documentation

---

# What you're about to learn

This unit is about documentation, and by the end, you will:

* Know where documentation is stored for Kubernetes
* Understand the importance of localization
* Understand the process and responsibilities for updating documentation
* Know who is responsible for documentation
* Locate the style guide and other guidance for writing documentation

---

# How is the Kubernetes documentation organized?

The documentation for the Kubernetes project can be divided into a number of categories.

* User-facing documentation
* Community documentation
* Special Interest Group (SIG) documentation

---

# What is the user-facing Kubernetes documentation?

The user-facing documentation deals with how to install, configure, and operate Kubernetes and its subsystems.

* It also includes API documentation.
* [It is available on the Kubernetes website.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)

---

# What is the community documentation?

The [community documentation](https://www.kubernetes.dev/) is an informal collection of docs maintained by contributors. It consists of:

* [The Contributor Guide](/docs/)
* [The Developer Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel/)
* [The Community website](https://www.kubernetes.dev/)

---

# What is the SIG documentation?

Each SIG is in control of some aspect of Kubernetes development, infrastructure, or community.

* They each document their domains and processes in different ways.
* Consequently, the documentation is stored in many different places and varies widely in how complete it is.
* Here are some of the best:
    * [SIG Release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release) handles the process of releasing new Kubernetes versions.
    * You already saw lots of [SIG Testing documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel/sig-testing) in a previous unit.

# Is the documentation available in other languages?

Είσαι τυχερός που τα έγγραφα είναι διαθέσιμα στα Αγγλικά!*

Kubernetes is used by developers and DevOps people _all over the world._ It is important that the documentation is available in other languages.

* Can you write documentation in a language that isn't English? We would love your help!
* Access user-facing documentation in other languages [from the documentation pages](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

<small>* Translation: "You're lucky the documentation is available in English!"</small>

---

# Who is responsible for the documentation?

YOU ARE! <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

---

# No, seriously!

All of the contributors are responsible for documentation.

* Any user-facing changes should be documented.
* Any developer-facing changes should be documented.
* Any changes in SIG processes should be documented.

When you make a change, document it.

---

# What is the process for updating the documentation?

Documentation updates follow the same process as any other contribution.

* All of our documentation is written in Markdown.
    * Including these slides!
* Use the pull request process to submit changes to documentation.

---

# How do we keep the documentation useful and consistent?

Of course the last slide is the million dollar question.

* It is only through the efforts of contributors like you that the documentation stays useful and consistent.
* Pay attention to any visible changes your contributions are making! Always ask yourself, "How will this affect the documentation?"
