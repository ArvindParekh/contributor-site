**NOTE:** You must go through vaccine verification and pick up your badge before
attending the summit or social evening event.

## Steering AMA

The Summit will start off with an AMA with members of the Kubernetes Steering
Committee.  Bring any and all questions about how we're running the project,
ongoing efforts & issues, and whatever you'd like to discuss with Steering.

## Unconference

The Contributor Summit will be an [Unconference-style event](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/08/30/henrikkniberg/what-is-an-unconference).  This means that
you should arrive with topics in mind, and we will pitch them and vote on them
in the morning, and then hold sessions in the afternoon, after the Steering AMA.
This is the format used at many [DevOps Days](https://devopsdays.org/open-space-format/), and helps us accommodate changing 
needs and unpredictable travel schedules.

If you already have a topic in mind, we urge you to [add it to the Topics issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site/pull/306)
so that other contributors can arrive mentally prepared for it.  This is
especially crucial if you think you might not make it to the Summit until 
afternoon.
