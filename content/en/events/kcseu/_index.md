### About

The Europe Summit will be a lightweight event taking place on May 16th
in Valencia, Spain alongside 
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KubeCon</a>
at the
<a href="https://www.feriavalencia.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Feria Valencia</a>.

Similar to North America summit last year, the summit in Europe will be
informal with minimal programming, but plenty of space to hang out, catch up,
and meet new contributors.


We are looking for [SIG meetings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LS1q4VJajZkNZODdMnJ4eH3XnTsE_4em6pjQgToHyfw/edit?usp=sharing), 
[session topics and leaders for unconference sessions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/6633), plus
one or more pre-planned plenary sessions.  If you have an idea for a session, or 
if your SIG wants to use the Contributor Summit to have an in-person work session
or meeting, please [email us].

There will also be a documentation sprint, led by SIG Docs.

This page will be updated with more information as it develops. If you have
questions or comments, please reach out to the Summit Staff by emailing
community@kubernetes.io or asking in the
<a href="https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/contributor-summit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#contributor-summit</a>
slack channel.
