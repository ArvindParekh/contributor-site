### Will I be able to attend remotely?

No, based on our experience with Kubecon NA 2021, we do not expect to be able
to support remote access for this event.


### Why is vaccination required to attend in-person?

As a co-located event, the summit is required to adhere to KubeConâ€™s
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/attend/health-and-safety/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
Health & Safety Guidelines</a>. There may be additional restrictions that
develop closer to the event, and we will update the event accordingly to follow
venue, municipality and CDC guidelines at a minimum.


### Why do I need to be a Kubernetes Org member to attend in-person?

With uncertain attendance and staffing, we made this decision to ensure we can
put on an event to the best of our ability.

Kubernetes Orgs:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kubernetes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-client" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kubernetes-client</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-csi rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kubernetes-csi</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kubernetes-sigs</a></li>
</ul>

If you are not yet a member, but active within the project, please consider
joining! The process of joining is straight forward. See our [org membership]
docs for more information. If your application to join is pending, please
contact us at community@kubernetes.io about registering.

### What is a sponsored attendee?

If you are a SIG lead or subproject owner and there is someone that is not yet
an org member or from another project that might take part in a panel,
SIG face-to-face meeting etc, you can sponsor them to attend the summit.
Please reach out to community@kubernetes.io to make arrangements.



### Will there be a New Contributor Workshop?

No, with uncertain attendance and staffing, we made this decision to ensure we
can put on an event to the best of our ability. For those that are interested
in becoming a contributor, SIG ContribEx plans to launch a course later this year.
