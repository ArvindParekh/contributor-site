### Will I be able to attend remotely?

No, based on our experience with Kubecon NA 2021, we do not expect to be able
to support remote access for this event.


### Do I need to wear a mask?

All attendees are required to wear masks except when eating or drinking. Eating and drinking should be kept to designated areas.

### Why do I need to be a Kubernetes Org member to attend in-person?

We welcome everyone to start contributing to the project, but with 1600+
Kubernetes Org members and limited space and budget requirements we've
made the decision to limit attendance to those that are already actively
engaged with the project.

If you are not yet a member, but active within the project, please consider
joining! The process of joining is straight forward. See our [org membership]
docs for more information. If your application to join is pending, please
contact us at community@kubernetes.io about registering.

Kubernetes Orgs:

### What is a sponsored attendee?

If you are a SIG lead or subproject owner and there is someone that is not yet
an org member or from another project that might take part in a panel,
SIG face-to-face meeting etc, you can sponsor them to attend the summit.
Please [email us] to make arrangements.

### I have an idea for a session

A CFP will be lauching mid August, check back soon!

### My SIG wants to meet at the Summit

We will provide space for SIG, WG, Committee, and other Kubernetes team meetings
at the Summit. If you think your team will want to hold one of these, please use
the CFP form to apply.

### Will there be a doc sprint?

Yes, SIG-Docs plans to hold a Doc Sprint at the Summit, which will run for the
full day from 11am to 5pm.

### Will there be a New Contributor Workshop?

No, they are very time, person and resource intensive. We encourage those
interested in becoming a contributor to use the New Contributor Course 
slated to launch later this year.
