**NOTE:** You **MUST** pick up your badge before attending the summit or social evening event.

## CFP

A [CFP] for sessions is open through Friday, September 15th.

[CFP]: https://forms.gle/htQSHpot9rp1csDz8

## Steering AMA

The Summit will start off with an AMA with members of the Kubernetes Steering
Committee.  Bring any and all questions about how we're running the project,
ongoing efforts & issues, and whatever you'd like to discuss with Steering.

## Preselected Sessions

The Contributor Summit will have two rooms of preselected sessions submitted
through our CfP.  This will include current development and community issue
discussions, introducing new initiatives, workshops for improving contributor
skills, and other sessions by and for Kubernetes contributors.

## SIG Meetings

Included in our preselected sessions will be several SIG, WG, and team meetings.
If your SIG/team in Kubernetes has enough people at Kubecon to have a face-to-face
meeting, take advantage of it and host one. SIG meetings are open to all attendees.

## Unconference

The Contributor Summit will include one track of
[Unconference-style sessions](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/08/30/henrikkniberg/what-is-an-unconference).  
After the CfP closes, contributors will be able to pitch and vote on last-minute
sessions in a GitHub Issue, and final selection of those topics will be made
at the Summit itself.  This allows us to incorporate community issues and ideas
that come to light after the CfP ends.

This is the format used at many [DevOps Days](https://devopsdays.org/open-space-format/), and helps us accommodate changing
needs and unpredictable travel schedules.

If you have a topic in mind, please check back soon - we'll launch a tracking issue for submissions closer to the event.

## Doc Sprint

SIG-Docs will have a full-day Documentation working session during the Summit.
If you contribute to the docs -- and who doesn't -- or you want to learn to
do it better, join them.
