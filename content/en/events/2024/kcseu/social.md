The Summit will include a social event open only to Contributors (and their family members, see Guests below).  This event will take place somewhere near the Summit venue, and will include food, drink, entertainment, and games.  More information will be available once the venue is booked.

**Contributors must be registered for the Summit in order to attend the Social.**

### Location

TBD

## Bringing A Guest

Contributors will be able to bring a single family member or partner to the
Social. This does not include coworkers or casual friends; our intention is
to support domestic partners and close family of contributors by including
them.

**NOTE:** Guests must adhere to all KubeCon health & safety requirements.

More information on Guest registration to come, closer to the event.
