**NOTE:** You **MUST** pick up your badge before attending the summit or social evening event.

## Steering AMA

The Summit will start off with an AMA with members of the Kubernetes Steering
Committee.  Bring any and all questions about how we're running the project,
ongoing efforts & issues, and whatever you'd like to discuss with Steering.

## Unconference

The Summit will include Unconference sessions, probably in the afternoon.  If important discussions arise after the close of the CfP, plan to pitch them as Unconference sessions.  More details to come.

## Doc Sprint

SIG-Docs will have a full-day Documentation working session during the Summit.
If you contribute to the docs -- and who doesn't -- or you want to learn to
do it better, join them.
