**NOTE:** You **MUST** pick up your badge before attending the summit or social evening event.

## Steering AMA

The Summit will start off with an AMA with members of the Kubernetes Steering
Committee.  Bring any and all questions about how we're running the project,
ongoing efforts & issues, and whatever you'd like to discuss with Steering.

## Unconference

The Contributor Summit will include one track of
[Unconference-style sessions](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/08/30/henrikkniberg/what-is-an-unconference).  
After the CfP closes, contributors will be able to pitch and vote on last-minute
sessions in a GitHub Issue, and final selection of those topics will be made
at the Summit itself.  This allows us to incorporate community issues and ideas
that come to light after the CfP ends.

This is the format used at many [DevOps Days](https://devopsdays.org/open-space-format/), and helps us accommodate changing
needs and unpredictable travel schedules.

If you have a topic in mind, please add it to the [Unconference Topics Issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/7692)

## Doc Sprint

SIG-Docs will have a full-day Documentation working session during the Summit.
If you contribute to the docs -- and who doesn't -- or you want to learn to
do it better, join them.

## CFP

A [CFP](https://forms.gle/mkJ7Q18LoQwRV1LPA) for sessions is open through <s>Sunday, February 4th</s> Wednesday, February 14th. Please, expect the schedule to be announced on February 25th, 2023.
It will cover presentation, workshop and collaboration style sessions. Unconference sessions should use the Github issue referenced above.
