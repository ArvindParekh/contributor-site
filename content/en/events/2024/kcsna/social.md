## Bringing A Guest

Contributors will be able to bring a single family member or partner to the
Social. This does not include coworkers or casual friends; our intention is
to support domestic partners and close family of contributors by including
them. **Flanker is a 21+ venue, and as such we will not be able to accommodate children.**

**NOTE:** Guests must adhere to all KubeCon health & safety requirements.

To bring a guest, please email summit-team@kubernetes.io with their information.
